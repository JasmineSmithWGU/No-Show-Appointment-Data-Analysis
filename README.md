# No-Show-Appointment-Data-Analysis
Dataset Description
We will be analyzing the No-Show Appointment data set. This data is derived from 100,000 medical appoinments in Brazil. We will be using this data to analyze if there is a difference in characteristics between a patient that shows up for their appointment versus the patient that does not. The "Patient ID" and "Appointment ID" are used to identify the patient information with the correlated appointment date. "Gender" and "Age" are used as patient identifiers without sharing personal information. The "ScheduledDay" is the date the patient scheduled the appointment on. "AppointmentDay" is the actual appointment day that the appointment is scheduled for. "Neighbourhood" represents the location of the hospital in Brazil. "Scholarship" is if a patient is enrolled in the welfare program "Bolsa Familia". "Hipertension", "Diabetes", "Alcoholism", and "Handcap" will be used to identify if a patient has a illness or disability. "SMS Recieved" shows if a patient has opted in for recieving a text message notifcation for their appointment. "No-Show" is if the patient has missed or shown up for their appointment; "Yes" if the appointment was missed and "No" if the patient did arrive.
